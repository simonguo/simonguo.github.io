## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª‚Äç

I'm Simon Guo! I'm a creator, and a passionate front-end engineer. Originally from China, I found my love for React and created [@rsuite](https://rsuitejs.com/) in the summer of 2016. Since then, I've worked on a plethora of web projects and have gained a wealth of experience.

## My Work üíª

Currently, I'm the Technical Director of HYPERS - a company that's all about providing intelligent marketing solutions for businesses. As a product development and management expert, I lead our team in developing a range of products, including [HYPERS OMNI-CHANNEL ANALYTICS](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/channel/), 
[HYPERS ADVERTISING ANALYTICS](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/adserving/), 
[HYPERS CONSENT MANAGER](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/consentmanager/), [HYPERS AUDIENCE CENTER](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/audiencecenter/), [HYPERS AD SERVING](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/adserving/), and [HYPERS CAMPAIGN STUDIO](https://www.hypers.com/en/product/campaignstudio/)

But enough about work! Outside of the office, you can find me daydreaming about my next DIY project, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in my love for spicy food.

If you're skilled in big data, testing, web services, or even if you're just interested in joining our dynamic team, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me via email at simonguo.2009@gmail.com or connect with me on Zhihu at [simonet](https://www.zhihu.com/people/simonet). Let's make some magic happen! üöÄ
